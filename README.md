# Malaria_detection_using_tensorflow_UI
Complete Malaria detection project with User Interface with a good accuracy.

![](/User_interface.PNG)

# Steps to folllow
1. first install jupyter notebook using command **pip install jupyterlab**
2. Then run the shell one by one without making any changes
3. Here I have used simple deeplearning technique using CONV2D and POOLING layes in file **malaria_det_tensor.ipynb**
4. And also used Transfer learning technique to train my model using Inception_V3 in the file **malaria_det_transfer.ipynb**
5. Here i got an accuracy of nearly 89% in **malaria_det_tensor.ipynb** and 85% in **malaria_det_transfer.ipynb**
6. U can experiment on increasing the number of layers or using different pre-trained models instead of inception_v3 for better accuracy.
7. Then run the **malaria_det_UI.py** file to get an interactive UI for the project. Just fill the image in the Entry **Donot forget the extention in of your image ".png or .jpg".
8. and the click the button **CHECK** to see the result.

# CAUTIONS!

Please install the labraries first using **pip install requirments.txt** before doing anything in the project. USING **Command Prompt**


Here i have included the data set with two different names **data and dataset** pls donot delete any of the folder or images from the directory.

U can add **sample cells** in **images_for_testing** folder for testing the microscopic cell samples obtained from Labs.


If u use the project Do give a credit as **Datapirate**
